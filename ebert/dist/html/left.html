                <span class="col-9">Let's start by holding the violin! <br><br>
                    The violin goes on the left shoulder, the left cheekbone resting on the chin rest.
                    Try not to tense your neck or press down on the violin, the weight of the head will be plenty. </span>
                <span class="col"><img src="/ebert/src/images/chinrest.jfif" alt=""></span>

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                Tip: Don't rest your chin on the chin rest, someone gave it the wrong name!<br>
                The violin is meant to be on the side, it's not a beard.

                Some pointers for holding the violin:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The violin should rest on the base of the index, 
                        don't let it sink too low in your hand!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try to keep your arm nice and straight, avoid any weird bends
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't grab, squeeze or press, a violin is very light, 
                        so gentle support is plenty to keep it in the air
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                        When we can comfortably hold the violin with head and hand without 
                        tension or feeling like it'll fall, it's time to add some fingers to the mix.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try keeping the fingers bent towards the strings: 
                        the closer they are, the easier playing will be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also try to make sure the fingers touch each other as little as possible.
                        If your fingers are stuck together, you'll run into difficulties as you progress!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't feel bad if anything seems hard to do, it's a process that takes time!
                    </p>

                <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                    Tip: Get a violinist to paste some indicating tape under the strings.
                    This will make playing in tune easier before your ears have caught up to your fingers.
                    Any non-transparent tape cut thin will do.
                </div>

					<p>
                        Let's test out those fingers! <br>
                        The fingers of the left hand will each get a number, 
                        starting with the index as 1, up to the little finger, which is 4.
                        The thumb doesn't get a number as it doesn't move.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lightly press the 1st finger (index) on the string about 3cm 
                        from the start of the fingerboard (or look at the first indicating tape, much easier!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make sure not to press too hard, this doesn't help the sound and will hurt your fingers!
                    </p>
				</div>
                <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                    Tip: The rounder the fingers, the better the sound!
                </div>
			</div>
            <div class="block">

				<div>
					<p>
                        Now, without lifting the 1st finger, we'll add a 2nd (middle) finger. <br>
                        There should be about as much space between the 1st and 2nd 
                        as there is between the 1st and the start of the fingerboard (called the 'nut').
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make sure your 1st and 2nd finger don't touch anywhere, 
                        as this will often result in a too low 2nd finger.
                    </p>
				</div>
			</div>
            <div class="block">
				<img src="/ebert/src/images/left_3.jpg" alt="image" style="object-position: 0px -60px;">
				<div>
                    <p>
                        Try adding a 3rd (ring) finger. <br>
                        The tip of the 3rd should be right next to the 2nd finger,
                        but still try to keep the rest of the fingers from touching.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping the tips of these 2 fingers together will make it easier
                        to put them on the right place.
                    </p>
				</div>
			</div>
            <div class="block block-lg no-clear">
				<img src="/ebert/src/images/left_4.jpg" alt="image" style="object-position: 0px -90px;">
				<div>
                    <p>
                        We've arrived at the final finger!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 4th (little) finger is often a bit harder, but don't let this discourage you! <br>
                        Put the 4th finger on the string, leaving almost as much space between 3 and 4 as there is between 1 and 2. <br>
                        For most people, this finger will have to be a bit flatter to reach the right spot,
                        but try to keep it at least a bit rounded! (if you can't reach the string, turn the hand closer to the violin)
                    </p>
				</div>
                <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                    Tip: One of the hardest things about the 4th finger is getting it to stay
                    close to the string when it isn't placed down, but once you've mastered this,
                    it will be much faster and more accurate!
