						The first step towards a good right hand is relaxation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Shake off all tension in your hand and let it hang down. <br>
						Now, using the other hand, raise the back part of the bow (the frog) 
						under the fingers, into the middle phalanx bone of the index. (black line on the picture) <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Keep your muscles entirely relaxed, while you push the bow up
						until the back of your hand is parallel to the floor.

					Tip: Relaxation is key to playing the violin! <br>
					All tension, anywhere in the body, will work against the natural resonance of the violin

					<p>
						Without tensing anything, put your thumb in between the wood 
						and the hair of the bow, against the frog. 
						This should leave your thumb under the middle and ring finger.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final touch to our bowhold will be to put the little finger 
						on top of the bow. <br> 
						Both the thumb and the little finger should be nicely rounded, <br>
						forming a kind of broken circle if you look at them from the side.
					</p>

					<p>
						Make sure to keep all fingers relaxed and round. <br>
						Just like when they were hanging down before,
						the fingers shouldn't touch, nor be too far apart.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you let go of the bow with the left hand, 
						you'll notice the little finger has to do a lot of work, 
						but don't worry, when the bow is on the violin, 
						the violin does a lot of this work for us!

						Time to put the bow on the strings and make some sound! <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of the time, we'll have the violin between the fingerboard and the bridge. 
						For now, put the bow in about 1/3 of this distance, starting at the fingerboard:
						Around this place, it's easiest to make a nice sound.
					</p>
					<p>
						Try moving the bow across one of the strings. 
						Don't put any pressure on, the weight of the bow is plenty! <br>
						Look at the bow to make sure it stays parallel to the bridge,
						otherwise, the bow will move to the side.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
					Tip: Try playing on all 4 strings with each of the 4 fingers as well, <br>
					then you've already played about half of the notes you can play on a violin! <br>
					Thanks for reading this intro to the violin, and remember to practice!
